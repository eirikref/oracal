These files contain code meant to help you understand and use the
Oracle Calendar extension.

oracallib.php is a wrapper around the extension itself, meant to make
it easier to handle the UTF8 encoding and decoding and so on.

Not all the code has been fully tested, but what has been tested seems
to work just fine.  Feel free to send patches to joepletcher@gmail.com
